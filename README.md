#AndroidMalwareDL

Many researchers explored a variety of Machine learning based models for detecting Android malware. However, selecting the most appropriate model is not straightforward, since there are several aspects that must be considered. 
<br>
Contributing to this domain, we share 4 python scripts that explore Android malware detection from diverse perspectives. 
<br>
Specifically, the scripts below conduct training, optimizing, and evaluating 27 machine learning algorithms by enabling LazyPredict framework, and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). During the optimization phase, it is performed hyperparameter analysis using the Optuna framework. 
<br>
The evaluation phase includes the measurement of different performance metrics against a contemporary, rich dataset. The best model is further interpreted by conducting feature analysis, using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework.
Briefly, the repository contains the following files:<br>
a)	ML_Malware_Detection_by_applying_LazyPredict.py – Enables LazyPredict analysis for the ML models<br>
b)	DeepNN_Malware_Detection_by_applying_OPTUNA.py – Enables OPTUNA framework for the DNN model<br>
c)	XGBoost_Malware_Detection_by_applying_OPTUNA.py – Enables OTPUNA framework for the XGBoost model<br>
d)	DeepNN_Malware_Detection_by_applying_SHAP.py – Enables SHAP analysis for the DNN model<br>
e)	NEW3_permissions_and_intent_vectors_raw_csv.csv – Contains 2000 permissions and intents extracted from different Android Applications.<br>
